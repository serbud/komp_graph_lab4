The person I admire most is Angelina Jolie. She 
was born on 4th June 1975 and grew up in Los    
Angeles where her father worked as an actor.    
She studied at Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute  
and acted in theatre and music videos.          
Later, she worked as a model in London and      
New York before becoming a famous Hollywood     
actor. She has starred in many great films.     
The reason I admire Angelina is because she is a
great actor. She is also very brave because she 
does her own stunts sometimes. I also admire
